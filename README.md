The next generation banking investment.

# Inspiration
We all want to save money, but how do we know the best way to save? This is a common question that lingers in almost everyone’s mind. At first, saving may seem like a daunting task: Remember, though, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

WishWad provides a very easy solution to the problem.

# What it does
WishWad helps you save with every transaction you make. The idea is to take the amount of every transaction and round it off to the nearest number and put the difference in a separate wishlist account. For example, you made a purchase at Chipotle Grill of $ 25.1, we round it off to $ 26.0 and put 90 cents to your wishlist account. In that way, you can save with every transaction without even noticing that you are actually saving. This however, doesn’t mean that this is the only saving you will have, but it will help you in building a better savings plan.
